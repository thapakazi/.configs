[00:31.35]Bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole
[00:34.36]Me and Shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
[00:38.53]I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
[00:40.74]Though I ain't wrapped tight
[00:42.40]My blood type's the '80s!

[00:46.50]You still fly kites daily!
[00:48.37]Catch me in my Mercedes
[00:49.53]Bumpin' "Ice, Ice Baby," screamin' Shady 'til I die
[00:52.15]Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
[00:54.07]So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
[00:56.63]And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
[00:59.49]Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Damn)
[01:02.53]Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous

[01:11.18]You morons think that I'm a genius
[01:12.77]Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
[01:15.69]Crazy, I am back, and I am razor sharp, baby
[01:19.35]And that's back wit' a capital B wit' an exclamation mark, maybe
[01:21.70]You should listen when I flip the linguistics

[01:33.46]Livin' life in the fast lane
[01:34.81]Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
[01:37.86]Only got a gallon in the gas tank
[01:40.16]But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
[01:43.62]I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
[01:46.42]Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
[01:49.65]I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
[01:52.17]I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
[01:55.31]My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
[01:57.59]At war wit' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
[02:00.66]My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
[02:03.82]I made a pact with the Devil that says "I'll let you take me
[02:06.37]You let me take this shovel, dig up the corspes, Jack Kevorkian"
[02:09.01]Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
[02:11.85]I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
[02:13.72]My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
[02:15.83]Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity
