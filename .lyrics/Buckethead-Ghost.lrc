[00:03.19]小七七很爱喵喵
[00:07.42]宝贝，我想你了
[00:16.21]I fell the things I said but never said how I felt
[00:23.49]I know I waited much too long
[00:30.77]Could I get it in your head
[00:34.52]Without a hit below the belt
[00:38.71]Looking back it seems that I went about it all wrong
[00:47.23]Lying alone in the bed we made
[00:50.83]Watching headlights on the shade
[00:54.43]The ghost that's sleeping by your side
[00:58.16]Are my promises to you that died
[01:16.73]Was it long ago when forever was our friend
[01:24.04]But now freedom's what I feel inside
[01:29.76]It hurts so much to let you go
[01:34.83]To know we'll never touch again
[01:38.75]When I walk if I fall down
[01:42.47]Can I take it in stride?
[01:47.76]Lying alone in the bed we made
[01:51.34]Watching headlights on the shade
[01:54.89]The ghost that's sleeping by your side
[01:58.76]Are my promises to you that died
[02:09.94]I might let you go but I'll never go away
[02:17.21]I might let you go but I'll never go away
[02:48.17]I fell the things I said but never said how I felt
[02:56.57]I know I waited much too long
[03:04.52]Lying alone in the bed we made
[03:08.30]Watching headlights on the shade
[03:11.95]The ghost that's sleeping by your side
[03:15.65]Are my promises to you that died
[03:19.30]Lying alone in the bed we made
[03:22.88]Watching headlights on the shade
[03:26.50]The ghost that's sleeping by your side
[03:30.36]Are my promises to you that died
