[00:00.40]
[00:00.87]You said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
[00:08.16]I'm gonna put it six feet underground
[00:14.61]Said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
[00:21.80]Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls
[00:27.21]
[00:28.64]Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
[00:35.64]Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
[00:42.19]Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
[00:49.25]And do back the things they did to you in return
[00:54.14]
[01:13.64]Said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
[01:20.77]If you can tell me something worth fighting for
[01:27.30]Oh I'm gonna buy this place is what I said
[01:34.38]Blame it upon a rush of blood to head
[01:39.47]
[01:44.88]Honey, all the movements we're starting to make
[01:53.89]See me crumble and fall on my face
[02:01.30]And I know the mistakes that I made
[02:07.75]See it all disappear without a trace
[02:15.36]And they call as they beckon you on
[02:21.78]They say start as you mean to go on
[02:27.54]
[02:36.87]Start as you mean to go on
[02:41.46]
[02:53.70]Said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
[03:00.64]Stand here beside me baby watch the orange glow
[03:07.76]Some'll laugh, some just sit and cry
[03:14.53]You just sit down then you wonder why
[03:18.99]
[03:21.28]So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
[03:28.46]If you can tell me something worth fighting for
[03:35.15]And I'm gonna buy this place is what I said
[03:42.28]Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
[03:48.25]To the head, oh
[03:52.33]Honey, all the movements we're starting to make
[04:01.66]See me crumble and fall on my face
[04:08.78]And I know the mistakes that I made
[04:15.52]See it all disappear without a trace
[04:22.65]And they call as they beckon you on
[04:29.50]They say start as you mean to go on
[04:35.24]
[04:39.05]As you mean to go on, as you mean to go on
[04:43.78]
[04:59.92]So meet me by the bridge
[05:03.55]Oh meet me by the lake
[05:06.63]When am I gonna see that pretty face again?
[05:13.82]Meet me on the road
[05:17.21]Meet me where I said
[05:20.88]Blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head
[05:28.01]
[05:36.99]
