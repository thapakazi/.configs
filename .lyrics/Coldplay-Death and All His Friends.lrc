[00:06.64]Away over on the rooftops let's get married
[00:14.51]All summer we just hurried
[00:20.82]So come over just be patient and don't worry
[00:27.96]So come over just be patient and don't worry
[00:34.77]
[01:03.90]So come over just be patient and don't worry
[01:16.65]And don't worry
[01:20.72]
[02:44.86]No I don't want a battle from beginning to end
[02:48.26]I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
[02:51.78]I don't want to follow death and all of his friends
[02:55.69]
[02:57.82]No I don't want a battle from beginning to end
