[00:02.04]Honey you are a rock
[00:09.38]Upon which I stand

[00:24.03]I hope you understand
[00:27.71]
[00:30.08]That Green Eyes
[00:33.35]Yeah, the spotlight shines upon you
[00:44.76]And how could anybody deny you?

[02:41.27]And it feels so much lighter since I met you
[02:52.45]And honey you should know
