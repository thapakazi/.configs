[00:28.10]They were sitting
[00:30.25]They were sitting in the strawberry swing
[00:38.49]Every moment was so precious
[00:49.49]They were sitting
[00:52.27]They were talking in the strawberry swing
[00:59.96]Everybody was for fighting
[01:05.06]Wouldn't wanna waste a thing
[01:11.52]Cold, cold water
[01:14.54]Bring me round
[01:17.26]Now my feet won't touch the ground
[01:23.56]Cold, cold water
[01:25.99]What you say?
[01:29.76]It's such…
[01:32.77]Such a perfect day
[01:39.05]It's such a perfect day
[01:46.00]I remember
[01:47.95]We were walking up to strawberry swing
[01:55.01]I can't wait 'til the morning
[02:00.12]Wouldn't wanna change a thing
[02:08.40]People leaving all the time
[02:12.74]Inside a perfectly straight line
[02:18.16]Don't you wanna curve away
[02:25.07]It's such…
[02:27.54]It's such a perfect day
[02:33.90]It's such a perfect day
[02:52.36]Now the sky could be blue
[03:02.63]I don't mind
[03:06.42]Without you it's a waste of time
[03:11.74]Could be blue
[03:14.24]I don’t mind
[03:17.80]Without you it's a waste of time
[03:22.50]Could be blue,
[03:25.26]could be grey
[03:28.96]without you I'm just miles away
[03:33.72]could be blue
[03:37.11]I don't mind
[03:39.50]Without you it's a waste of time
