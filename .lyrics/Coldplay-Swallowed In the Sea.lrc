[03:51.44][00:00.40]Swallowed In The Sea
[03:54.29]music
[00:09.09]You cut me down a tree
[00:13.43]And brought it back to me
[00:17.05]And that's what made me see
[00:20.54]Where I was going wrong
[00:24.06]You put me on a shelf
[00:27.57]And kept me for yourself
[00:31.09]I can only blame myself
[00:34.78]You can only blame me
[00:37.99]And I could write a song
[00:41.97]A hundred miles long
[00:45.53]Well, that's where I belong
[00:48.42]And you belong to me
[00:52.78]And I could write it down
[00:56.53]Or spread it all around
[01:00.21]Get lost and then get found
[01:03.67]Or swallowed in the sea
[01:07.52]
[01:14.16]You put me on a line
[01:18.13]And hung me out to dry
[01:21.40]And darling that's when I
[01:24.19]Decided to go to see you
[01:28.12]You cut me down to size
[01:31.58]And opened up my eyes
[01:35.04]Made me realize
[01:38.44]What I could not see
[01:41.50]And I could write a book
[01:44.96]The one they'll say that shook
[01:48.38]The world, and then it took
[01:51.69]It took it back from me
[01:54.87]And I could write it down
[01:58.60]Or spread it all around
[02:01.85]Get lost and then get found
[02:05.07]And you'll come back to me
[02:08.54]Not swallowed in the sea
[02:15.11]
[02:24.02]Ooh...
[02:38.23]And I could write a song
[02:42.28]A hundred miles long
[02:45.56]Well, that's where I belong
[02:48.87]And you belong with me
[02:52.04]The streets you're walking on
[02:55.89]A thousand houses long
[02:59.02]Well, that's where I belong
[03:02.32]And you belong with me
[03:05.52]Oh what good is it to live
[03:09.19]With nothing left to give
[03:12.46]Forget but not forgive
[03:15.84]Not loving all you see
[03:18.94]Oh the streets you're walking on
[03:22.51]A thousand houses long
[03:25.88]Well that's where I belong
[03:29.12]And you belong with me
[03:32.43]Not swallowed in the sea
[03:35.77]You belong with me
[03:39.14]Not swallowed in the sea
[03:42.45]Yeah, you belong with me
[03:46.16]Not swallowed in the sea
