[00:14.84]Trouble

[00:29.84]Oh no, I see
[00:35.09]The spider web is tangled up with me
[00:40.08]And I lost my head
[00:45.54]And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

[01:06.52]Oh no, what's this?
[01:12.95]A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
[01:17.98]So I turn to run
[01:23.35]And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

[01:30.39]And I never meant to cause you trouble
[01:37.17]I never meant to do you wrong
[01:44.05]And ah, well if I ever caused you trouble
[01:50.92]Oh, no I never meant to do you harm

[02:12.70]Oh no, I see
[02:18.26]The spider web and it's me in the middle
[02:23.09]So I twist and turn
[02:28.55]But here am I in my little bubble

[02:34.80]Singing out 
[02:36.04]I never meant to cause you trouble
[02:42.42]I never meant to do you wrong
[02:49.31]And ah, well if I ever caused you trouble
[02:56.23]Oh, no I never meant to do you harm

[03:32.22]They spun a web for me
[03:38.77]They spun a web for me
[03:45.61]They spun a web for me
