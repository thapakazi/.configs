[00:08.97]Coldplay - Violet Hill
[00:38.97]
[00:40.97]Was a long and dark December
[00:44.00]From the rooftops I remember
[00:46.98]There was snow, white snow
[00:54.05]Clearly I remember from the window
[00:58.08]They were watching while we froze
[01:02.25]Down below
[01:04.82]
[01:06.25]When the future architecture
[01:09.18]By carnival of idiots on show
[01:14.88]You better lie low
[01:18.65]If you love me, won't you let me know
[01:25.21]
[01:29.91]Was a long and dark December
[01:32.81]When the banks became cathedrals
[01:35.97]And the frost became gone
[01:42.66]Creased cut stones and bibles
[01:45.52]Are all out to fade their rifles
[01:48.55]And the cross was held aloft
[01:55.53]There in me and I?
[01:57.89]
[01:58.27]When I'm dead hit the ground
[02:00.96]Legs are cold, unfold
[02:07.38]And If you love me, won't you let me know
[02:14.14]
[02:43.73]I don't wanna be a soldier
[02:47.03]With a captain of some sinking ship
[02:50.23]With snow
[02:52.98]Far below
[02:56.24]So, if you love, me why'd you let me go
[03:02.98]
[03:08.90]I took my love down to Violet Hill
[03:14.62]There we sat in snow
[03:19.43]All that time she was silenced still
[03:24.22]So, if you love me won't you let me know
[03:32.26]If you love me won't you let me know
