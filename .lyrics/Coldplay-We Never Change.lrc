[00:20.70]I wanna live life, never be cruel,
[00:30.87]I wanna live life, be good to you.
[00:42.64]I wanna fly, never come down,
[00:54.05]And live my life,
[00:59.38]And have friends around.
[01:08.67]We never change, do we?
[01:13.78]No...no...
[01:18.98]We never learn, do we?
[01:26.56]So I wanna live in a wooden house,
[01:37.30]I wanna live life, always be true,
[01:47.79]I wanna live life, and be good to you,
[01:59.76]I wanna fly, and never come down,
[02:11.03]And I live my life,
[02:16.72]And have friends around.
[02:26.04]We never change, do we?
[02:31.31]No...no...
[02:36.34]We never learned to leave.
[02:44.06]So I wanna live in a wooden house,
[02:55.77]Making more friends would be easy.
[03:09.61]Oh and I don't have a soul to save,
[03:19.95]Yes, and I sing every single day,
[03:30.93]We never change, do we?
[03:41.57]We never learn, do we?
[03:48.98]So, I wanna live life in a wooden house,
[03:54.44]Making more friends would be easy.
[03:59.68]I wanna live where the sun comes out
