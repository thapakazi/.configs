[00:33.92]Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
[00:43.23]To seize everything you ever wantedâ€¦One moment
[00:48.44]Would you capture it or just let it slip?
[00:51.33]
[00:53.00]His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
[00:55.80]There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's forgetting
[00:58.62]He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
[01:01.38]To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin
[01:04.17]What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
[01:06.91]He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
[01:09.67]He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
[01:12.42]The clock's run out, time's up over, BLOAH!
[01:15.35]Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
[01:18.30]Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
[01:20.25]He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy,
[01:22.85]No, he won't have it , he knows his whole back's to these ropes
[01:25.63]It don't matter, he's dope
[01:27.08]He knows that, but he's broke
[01:28.43]He's so stacked that he knows
[01:29.75]When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
[01:32.12]Back to the lab again yo
[01:33.91]This whole rap shit
[01:35.12]He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[01:37.18]You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[01:40.10]You own it, you better never let it go

[02:17.85]Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
[02:20.62]Lonely roads got him, he knows he's grown farther from home,
[02:22.31]he's no father
[02:24.81]He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
[02:27.49]But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water
[02:30.32]The hoes don't want him no more, he's cold prada
[02:33.14]They moved on to the next shmo who flows
[02:35.39]Who nose dove and sold nada
[02:37.26]And so the so proper, His toll, it unfolds
[02:39.75]and I suppose it's old, partner, but the beat goes on

[03:17.40]But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
[03:20.19]Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
[03:23.00]All the pain inside amplified by the
[03:26.15]Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
[03:28.83]Five and I can't provide the right type
[03:32.46]Of life for my family cuz man, these goddam food stamps

[03:39.22]And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
[03:42.05]Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
[03:43.85]Caught up between being a father and a pre-madonna
[03:47.74]Baby momma drama screamin' on her
[03:49.31]Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
[03:50.72]another damn or not has gotten me to the point
[03:53.04]I'm like a snail, i've got
[03:55.26]To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
[03:58.60]Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not
[04:02.18]Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
