[00:24.70]You spend your days counting the hours you're awake
[00:27.83]And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
[00:32.63]It's a burden you've been burying in spite of all your prayers
[00:38.03]As the light turns off inside your heart do you remember
[00:41.56]What it's like to care
[00:42.56]
[00:43.61]Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe
[00:46.19]
[00:46.67]Give me the drug, keep me alive, give me whats left of my life
[00:51.49]Let me go
[00:55.66]
[00:55.91]Pull this plug, let me breath
[00:57.80]On my own I'm finally free
[00:59.95]Let me go
[01:01.30]
[01:10.09]The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
[01:14.29]If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
[01:19.42]With the memories that haunt us, I charish just the same
[01:23.40]As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grave
[01:27.68]
[01:28.99]Yet I fall through these clouds and she's screaming
[01:32.17]
[01:33.67]Give me the drug, keep me alive
[01:35.27]Give me whats left of my life
[01:36.84]Let me go

[01:42.50]Pull this plug, let me breath
[01:43.13]On my own I'm finally free
[01:44.37]Let me go
[01:50.72]
[01:51.46]This grip loosens but it never breaks
[01:55.89]We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
[02:00.17]Your words are always there to break my fall
[02:04.82]And now I find the comfort to see through it all
[02:07.59]
[02:09.45]Guide me through uncharted waters
[02:13.77]Before we lose our way again
[02:18.32]Will you be my compass
[02:23.19]Until forever, until forever ends
[02:25.14]
[02:27.47]Knees are weak, hands are shaking
[02:27.82]I can't breathe

[02:30.64]Give me the drug,keep me alive
[02:32.17]Give me whats left of my life
[02:34.73]Let me go
[02:36.52]
[02:39.82]Pull this plug, let me breathe
[02:42.06]On my own I'm finally free
[02:44.30]Let me go (x3)
