Bout time for anyone telling you wrong for all your deeds
No sign the roarin' thunder stopped and called the read
No time
I Get in line and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone everyone
Love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up
You gotta let go
You'll never be loved
Till you make your own
You gotta face up
You gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low
Oh son of a stepfather
Oh son of a I'm so sorry
Oh son of a stepfather
Oh son of a I'm so sorry
No lies and no deceiving and what's loves
I keep trying to conceive that death is from above
No time
Get in line and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone everyone
Love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up
You gotta let go
You'll never be loved
Till you make your own
You gotta face up
You gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low
Oh son of a stepfather
Oh son of a I'm so sorry
Oh son of a stepfather
Oh son of a I'm so sorry
Life isn't always what you think it be
You turn your head for one second and tables turn
And I know I know that I did you wrong
Will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you
Somehow
Somehow
So you gotta fire up
You gotta let go
You'll never be loved
Till you make your own
You gotta face up
You gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low
Oh son of a stepfather
Oh son of a I'm so sorry
Oh son of a stepfather
Oh son of a I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Oh son of a
