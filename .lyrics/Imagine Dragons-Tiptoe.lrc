[00:00.20]Imagine Dragons - "Tiptoe"
[00:12.69].
[00:37.20]In the morning light
[00:39.20]Let my roots take flight
[00:41.01]Watch me fall above
[00:42.96]Like a vicious dove
[00:44.95]They don''t see me come
[00:46.95]Who can blame then?
[00:49.02]They never seem to catch my eye
[00:50.96]But I''ve never wondered why
[00:52.91].
[00:53.16]I won''t fall asleep
[00:56.91]I won''t fall asleep
[01:00.36].

[01:08.77]Take some time to
[01:10.96]Simmer down keep your head down low
[01:13.02]Hey yeah
[01:14.39]Tip toe higher

[01:25.21]From your slanted view
[01:27.08]See the morning dew
[01:29.02]Sink into the soil
[01:31.20]Watch the water boil
[01:33.15]They won''t see me run
[01:34.95]Who can blame them?
[01:36.83]They never look to see me fly
[01:38.96]So I never had to lie
[01:40.89].
[01:41.14]I won''t fall asleep
[01:44.89]I won''t fall asleep
[01:48.33].
