[00:24.59]In the day
[00:26.26]In the night
[00:28.19]Say it right
[00:30.26]Say it all
[00:32.44]You either got it
[00:34.45]Or you don't
[00:36.39]You either stand or you fall
[00:40.41]When your will is broken
[00:44.70]When it slips from your hand
[00:48.68]When there's no time for joking
[00:52.95]There's a hole in the plan
[00:56.35]
[02:03.00][00:57.36]Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
[02:11.09][01:05.46]No you don't mean nothing at all to me
[02:19.43][01:14.02]Oh you got what it takes to set me free
[02:27.54][01:22.02]Oh you could mean everything to me
[02:32.82][01:27.40]
[01:29.89]I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
[01:38.01]I can't say that I don't
[01:41.96]love the light and the dark
[01:46.12]I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
[01:54.47]And all of what I feel I could show
[02:00.58]You tonite you tonite
[02:02.84]
[02:35.59]From my hands I could give you
[02:39.60]Something that I made
[02:43.73]From my mouth
[02:45.69]I could sing you another brick that I laid
[02:51.78]From my body I could show you a place God knows
[03:00.10]You should know the space is holy
[03:04.17]Do you really want to go?
