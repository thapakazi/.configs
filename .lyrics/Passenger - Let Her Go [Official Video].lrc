[00:00.91]Let Her Go
[00:01.56]Passenger
[00:02.38]
[00:26.70]Well you only need the light when it's burning low
[00:30.34]Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
[00:33.52]Only know you love her when you let her go
[00:36.32]
[00:39.69]Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
[00:43.26]Only hate the road when youâ€™re missin' home
[00:46.51]Only know you love her when you let her go
[00:52.52]And you let her go
[00:53.88]
[01:06.26]Staring at the bottom of your glass
[01:08.63]Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
[01:11.54]But dreams come slow and they go so fast
[01:15.38]
[01:18.66]You see her when you close your eyes
[01:21.13]Maybe one day you'll understand why
[01:24.24]Everything you touch surely dies
[01:27.15]
[01:30.35]But you only need the light when it's burning low
[01:33.84]Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

[01:49.91]Only know you love her when you let her go
[01:52.49]
[01:56.98]Staring at the ceiling in the dark
[01:59.39]Same old empty feeling in your heart
[02:02.51]'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
[02:06.34]
[02:09.47]Well you see her when you fall asleep
[02:11.93]But never to touch and never to keep
[02:14.85]'Cause you loved her too much
[02:16.70]And you dived too deep
[02:18.64]
[02:21.37]Well you only need the light when it's burning low
[02:24.89]Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
