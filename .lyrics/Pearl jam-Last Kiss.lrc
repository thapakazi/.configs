[00:02.24]Oh where, oh where
[00:04.70]can my baby be
[00:07.41]The Lord took her
[00:08.76]away from me.
[00:10.96]She's gone to heaven
[00:13.04]so I've got to be good,
[00:14.98]so I can see my baby
[00:17.19]when I leave this world.
[00:21.07]
[00:23.55]We were out on a date
[00:25.53]in my daddy's car,
[00:28.06]we hadn't driven very far.
[00:31.79]There in the road,
[00:34.06]straight ahead,
[00:35.95]a car was stalled,
[00:38.49]the engine was dead.
[00:40.01]I couldn't stop,
[00:42.10]so I swerved to the right.
[00:44.42]I'll never forget
[00:46.19]the sound that night--
[00:48.64]the screamin tires,
[00:50.88]the bustin glass,
[00:52.87]the painful scream
[00:54.57]that I heard last.
[00:58.24]
[01:00.97]Oh where, oh where
[01:03.14]can my baby be?
[01:05.67]The Lord took her
[01:07.50]away from me.
[01:09.88]She's gone to heaven
[01:11.47]so I've got to be good,
[01:13.53]so I can see my baby
[01:15.70]when I leave this world.
[01:19.09]
[01:21.99]When I woke up,
[01:24.22]the rain was pourin down.
[01:25.99]There were people
[01:28.23]standin all around.
[01:30.59]Somethin warm
[01:32.40]flowin through my eyes,
[01:34.53]but somehow I found
[01:36.74]my baby that night.
[01:38.96]I lifted her head,
[01:40.64]she looked at me and said,
[01:42.92]"Hold me darlin just a little while."
[01:47.19]I held her close,
[01:49.04]I kissed her--our last kiss.
[01:51.44]I'd found the love
[01:53.26]that I knew I had missed.
[01:55.59]Well now she's gone,
[01:57.37]even though I hold her tight.
[01:59.82]I lost my love,
[02:01.54]my  life that night.
[02:05.07]
[02:07.85]Oh where, oh where
[02:10.27]can my baby be?
[02:12.48]The Lord took her away from me.
[02:16.40]She's gone to heaven
[02:18.25]so I've got to be good,
[02:20.21]so I can see my baby
[02:22.46]when I leave this world.
[02:26.08]
[02:28.60](...ooh ooh ooh...)
[02:33.07](...oh oh oh oh...)
