[00:27.00]Karma police arrest this man he talks in maths
[00:37.00]He buzzes like a fridge he's like a detuned radio
[00:52.00]Karma police arrest this girl her hitler hairdo
[01:03.00]Is making me feel ill
[01:05.00]and we have crashed her party.
[01:18.00]This is what you get. This is what you get.
[01:30.00]This is what you get when you mess with us.
[01:43.00]Karma police I've given all I can it's not enough
[01:54.00]I've given all I can but we're still on the payroll.
[02:09.00]This is what you get. This is what you get.
[02:21.00]This is what you get when you mess with us.
[03:24.00][02:46.00][02:34.00]Phew for a minute there I lost myself I lost myself
[03:16.00]I lost myself, I lost my self
