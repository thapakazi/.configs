[00:00.00]Drive By
[00:01.13]Train
[00:02.00]
[00:04.49]On the other side of a street I knew
[00:06.38]Stood a girl that looked like you
[00:08.33]I guess thats deja vu
[00:10.21]But I thought this can't be true
[00:11.87]Cause you moved to west L.A or
[00:14.45]New York or Santa Fe
[00:15.90]Or where or ever to get away from me
[00:18.81]
[00:20.27]Oh but that one night
[00:21.85]Was more than just right
[00:24.24]I didn't leave you cause I was all through
[00:28.21]Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
[00:32.29]Because I really fell for you
[00:35.43]Oh I swear to you
[00:38.07]I'll be there for you
[00:40.06]This is not a drive by-i-i-i-i-i
[00:44.09]Just a shy guy looking for a two ply
[00:47.63]Hefty bag to hold my i-i-i-i- love
[00:51.73]When you move me everything is groovy
[00:55.31]They don't like it sue me
[00:57.19]Umm way you do me
[00:59.29]Oh I swear to you
[01:01.53]I'll be there for you
[01:03.34]This is not a drive by-i-i-i-i
[01:07.67]
[01:09.48]On the other side of a downward spiral
[01:11.29]My love for you went viral
[01:13.38]And I loved you every mile you drove away
[01:16.85]But now here you are again
[01:19.03]So let's skip the "how you been"And
[01:21.13]get down to the "more than friends" at last
[01:23.55]
[01:25.02]Oh but that one night
[01:26.85]Is still the highlight
[01:29.19]I didn't leave you until I came to
[01:33.08]and I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
[01:36.99]Because I really fell for you
[01:40.66]Oh I swear to you
[01:42.71]I'll be there for you
[01:44.84]This is not a drive by-i-i-i-i-i
[01:48.87]Just a shy guy looking for a two ply
[01:52.08]Hefty bag to hold my i-i-i-i- love
[01:56.54]When you move me everything is groovy
[02:00.15]They don't like it sue me
[02:01.94]Umm way you do me
[02:04.14]Oh I swear to you
[02:06.27]I'll be there for you
[02:08.13]This is not a drive by-i-i-i-i
[02:12.51]Please believe that when I leave
[02:19.19]There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
[02:24.60]And a little time to get my head together too
[02:27.48]On the other side of a street I knew
[02:30.20]Stood a girl that looked like you
[02:31.74]I guess thats deja vu
[02:33.72]But I thought this can't be true
[02:35.31]Cause
[02:35.77]Oh I swear to you
[02:37.99]I'll be there for you
[02:39.96]This is not a drive by-i-i-i-i-i
[02:43.86]Just a shy guy looking for a two ply
[02:47.48]Hefty bag to hold my i-i-i-i- love
[02:51.44]When you move me everything is groovy
[02:55.20]They don't like it sue me
[02:57.05]Umm way you do me
